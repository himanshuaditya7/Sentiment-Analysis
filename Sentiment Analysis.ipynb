There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.</td>\n",

If there were 9 patients reporting SAEs, how can it be stated that \"no serious adverse event was reported for more than 1 patient...\"? Maybe I haven't read this right, or maybe there's a misprint. I'm very pleased that something is being developed for SPMS, and it's encouraging that siponimod doesn't linger for very long in the body.   \n",

There’re no new lesions in Brain/Cord and I’ve had no relapses while I was on Gilenya. This was a good sign. But there was one line in the cervical cord review that concerned me. It goes : “Lesions at C2-3 and T2 now show hypointensity on the post gadolinium T1 images only. This could represent artifact or early axonal loss.” That was bothersome to read. What are the kind of symptoms from C2-C3 lesion should I be aware of ? Would it result in change of my DMT ? Thanks.   \n",
